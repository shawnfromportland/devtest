### feat: Implement detailed technical changelog entries
- Modified `devtest/package.json` to remove `echo` commands from `git:commit` and `git:commit:push` scripts. These scripts no longer write to `scripts/.tmp_changelog_content.md`.
- Updated `devtest/.cursor/rules/git_workflow_rules.mdc` to instruct the AI (me) to:
    - Generate a conventional commit message.
    - Compile a list of significant changes from the session as bullet points.
    - Format the message and bullet points into a markdown block.
    - Write this markdown block to `scripts/.tmp_changelog_content.md` *before* invoking the npm commit scripts.
