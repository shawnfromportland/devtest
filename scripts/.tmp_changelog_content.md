### refactor: Remove commit hash linking from technical changelog titles
- Modified `devtest/scripts/update-technical-changelog.ts` in the `updateChangelogFile` function:
    - Removed logic for fetching GitHub repository URL and commit hash.
    - Simplified changelog entry titles to `### (YYYY-MM-DD) Commit Title Text`, removing the hyperlink.
- This change avoids a two-step commit amend process previously considered for accurate hash linking, simplifying the script and preventing multiple commits for a single changelog update.
